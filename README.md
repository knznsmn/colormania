JavaScript project that paints colors, I guess?


#### Note to self:
I want to create a tool that helps me choose colors.

To do:
 - [ ] Learn the harmony of colors.
 - [ ] Write a grid layout to use as a preview.
 - [ ] Incorporate the knowledge of color theory into the project.
 - [ ] Don't forget the coffee. The doctor said to drink at least eight glasses a day.
